I am currently a Postdoc at the Vision group at MIT working with [Phillip Isola](http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/). Prior to this, 
I was a Research Scientist at Butterfly Network, working with [Nathan Silberman](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/) and was an integral part
of the team that developed the [Auto Bladder Volume tool](https://twitter.com/ButterflyNetInc/status/1275827731138252801?s=20) among others. 

During my Ph.D. I was advised by [Prof. Rama Chellappa](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/faculty_staff/rama-chellappa-phd/). In my research, I have explored different 
aspects of deep learning representations from the point of  view of robustness and invariance. I have
worked on several topics such as Semantic Segmentation, Domain Adaptation, Adversarial learning, 
Multi task learning and Facial recognition systems. 

I am interested in developing learning algorithms that are not only certain about knowing things but
are also aware of their own uncertainties i.e. to know when they don't know.
